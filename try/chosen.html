                        <h2>Module 4: Family, Childhood, and Early Education of Rizal</h2>
                        <p>Jose Rizal was born into a wealthy and well-respected family in Calamba, Laguna. He was the seventh of eleven children of Francisco Mercado Rizal and Teodora Alonzo Realonda. <br />His ancestry was a mix of Chinese, Japanese, Spanish, and Malay bloodlines. Rizal's older brother, Paciano, played a significant role in his life, and his upbringing was shaped <br />by his large and religious family. His parents ensured that he and his siblings were raised with strong moral values and religious teachings.</p>

                            <p>During his childhood, Rizal displayed a keen curiosity and a love for learning. He spent much of his time in their family garden, where he enjoyed the stories told by his mother, sparking his <br />interest in folklore and legends. His mother, Teodora, played a crucial role in his early education, teaching him prayers and exposing him to Catholic teachings. The strong religious <br />foundation instilled in him during his childhood influenced his character and beliefs throughout his life.</p>
                            
                            <p>Rizal’s formal education began at home under his mother’s guidance, where he learned the alphabet at the age of three. He also had private tutors, including Leon Monroy, who taught him Latin, <br />and his uncles, who influenced his love for education and nature. He continued his studies in Calamba and later in Biñan under Maestro Justiniano Aquino Cruz. Despite the limitations of the <br />Spanish education system, Rizal excelled in academics, often surpassing his classmates. However, his intelligence led to jealousy among his peers, who tried to discredit him, though he remained resilient.</p>
                            
                            <p>Many influences shaped Rizal’s character and nationalism. His father, Francisco, taught him self-respect, independence, and a strong work ethic. His mother instilled in him religiosity, self-sacrifice, <br />and a love for the arts. His brother Paciano nurtured his passion for freedom and justice, while his sisters emphasized respect and kindness. Additionally, his uncles and the <br />environment he grew up in further enriched his intellectual and artistic development, paving the way for his future as a national hero.</p>
