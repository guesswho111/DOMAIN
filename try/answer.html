                        <p>1. The filmmakers discuss their intent to create a film about José Rizal. What challenges do they anticipate in portraying his life? 
                        </p>
                        <p>The filmmakers anticipate challenges in portraying Rizal's life due to the many gray areas and complexities, making it difficult to create a straightforward <br />narrative suitable for film, as his life doesn't easily fit into a heroic mold. They also acknowledge the difficulty in pleasing <br />everyone, as there are many different interpretations of Rizal's life and works. <strong>(01:22:38 - 01:23:50)</strong></p>
                    <p>2. A debate arises about the authenticity of Rizal's retraction document. What are the main
                        arguments presented regarding its validity?</p>
                        <p>The debate centers on whether Rizal's retraction of his writings and religious errors was genuine, with some arguing it diminishes his heroism and others <br />questioning the validity of the retraction document itself. Some believe the document is a forgery used to discredit Rizal's revolutionary ideals, while others argue that Rizal's actions were <br />influenced by his fear of execution and desire to marry Josephine. <strong>(00:52:40 - 00:55:45)</strong></p>
                        <p>3. The character of Josephine Bracken is introduced. How does the film depict her relationship with
                            Rizal?</p>
                            <p>The film portrays Josephine Bracken as a controversial figure, blamed by Rizal's family for causing scandal and disrupting their peace, though it <br />also hints at a deep love between her and Rizal. <strong>(00:37:40 - 00:44:07)</strong></p>
                    <p>4. The filmmakers interview a historian about Rizal's alleged retraction. What evidence is provided
                        to support or refute the claim?</p>  
                        <p>The historian questions the authenticity of Rizal's retraction, mentioning archival documents found in 1922 that contradict previous accounts and <br />highlighting the Rizal family's initial denial of the retraction. <strong>(00:54:34 - 01:01:18)</strong></p>      
                    <p>5. The film presents different portrayals of Rizal’s execution. How does each version differ, and what
                        do these differences suggest?</p>    
                        <p>The film presents Rizal's execution in different ways ready to face death, shot by Filipino soldiers, and given a Christian burial - while also <br />implying betrayal, suggesting conflicting interpretations of his final moments and legacy. <strong>(01:03:27 - 01:05:37)</strong></p>
                    <p>6. One of the characters questions whether Rizal was truly a hero. What reasoning do they give to
                        challenge his heroism?</p>
                        <p>A character questions Rizal's heroism, arguing that retracting his so-called religious errors and abandoning masonry would invalidate his <br />heroism and writings and questioning how he can be a national hero if he abandoned the revolution. <strong>(01:01:18 - 01:03:27)</strong></p>
                    <p>7. A scene features a discussion about Rizal’s religious beliefs. How does the film depict his stance
                        on faith and the Catholic Church?</p>
                        <p>The film portrays Rizal as critical of the Catholic Church's abuses and its influence on Philippine society while exploring his personal <br />faith and spirituality, showing a nuanced view beyond simple rejection. <strong>(00:28:23-00:29:55)</strong></p>
                    <p>8. The film uses a unique narrative style, including fictionalized conversations with Rizal. How does
                        this technique affect storytelling?</p>
                        <p>By including fictionalized conversations with Rizal, the film enables a more direct exploration of his thoughts, blurring the line between <br />fact and artistic interpretation and encouraging critical engagement. <strong>(00:02:50-00:04:09)</strong></p>
                    <p>9. At one point, the filmmakers express frustration with their research on Rizal. What specific issue
                        causes this frustration?</p>
                        <p>The filmmakers are frustrated by the overwhelming and conflicting information about Rizal, especially regarding his retraction, making <br />it difficult to find the truth. <strong>(00:52:18-00:54:40)</strong></p>
                    <p>10. The film concludes with a reflection on Rizal's legacy. How do the filmmakers interpret his impact
                        on contemporary Philippine society?</p>
                        <p>The filmmakers see Rizal's legacy as a continuing inspiration for social reform and national identity in the Philippines today, while <br />acknowledging that the issues he fought against, like corruption and inequality, still exist. <strong>(01:06:48-01:07:33)</strong></p>
